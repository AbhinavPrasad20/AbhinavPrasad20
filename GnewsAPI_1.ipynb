            "Content:\n",
            "ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. military wants to turn its satellite communications into something that works like the internet — fluid, fast, and built on seamless interoperability between networks. But at an industry conference this week, Pentagon officials said the long envisioned military space internet is still a long way off.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "In an era where commercial satellites outnumber military ones, the Defense Department is trying to tap into this diverse ecosystem, defense officials said June 17 at the SAE Media Group’s MilSatcom USA conference.\n",
            "\n",
            "The goal is creating what DoD calls “enterprise satcom” — a virtualized, software-defined network that could automatically reroute communications between military, commercial and allied nations’ satellites if an adversary jams one satellite system.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the reality today is an ecosystem full of manual processes, hardware silos and incompatible standards.\n",
            "\n",
            "When you travel internationally, your iPhone doesn’t need different hardware to connect to local cell networks. That’s thanks to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global collaboration that created unified technical standards for mobile networks decades ago.\n",
            "\n",
            "Satellite communications have no such standard. “The question always comes up: If DoD wants this ecosystem where users could roam across service provider networks, would we make that work?” said Mike Dean, director of command, control and communications infrastructure at the Defense Department. The answer is that a technical standard is needed comparable to the 3GPP.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dean hopes the satellite industry will have its own “3GPP moment,” but so far, that moment hasn’t arrived. The commercial satellite industry remains fragmented, with each company developing proprietary technologies that don’t play well with others. As Rajeev Gopal, vice president of Hughes Network Systems, put it: “Can I take a OneWeb modem and replace it with an Amazon Kuiper modem? I do not think that can be done today.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Bespoke ‘pizza boxes’ solutions\n",
            "\n",
            "Each branch of the armed services uses different satellite terminals, requiring expensive hardware upgrades to work with different commercial services. The result is what Paul Van Slett, head of the satellite communications division at the Pentagon’s Chief Information Office, calls “bespoke pizza boxes” — the custom hardware units that military facilities use to integrate different satellite providers’ modems.\n",
            "\n",
            "These pizza boxes, he said, are expensive and cumbersome to upgrade with new software. In fast-moving military situations where communication can mean the difference between life and death, this hardware-heavy approach is a liability.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Software upgrades are a lot faster than doing all the wiring and cabling and interoperability testing of new hardware,” Van Slett noted. Under the Pentagon’s vision for the future, he added, “if a new wave form is developed, I don’t have to buy a brand new modem and field another rack of bespoke pizza boxes to get to that capability.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The military has embraced commercial systems like SpaceX’s Starlink, which has gained market share precisely because it avoids the interoperability problem entirely. Starlink’s terminals are designed to work exclusively with SpaceX’s constellation.\n",
            "\n",
            "This creates a paradox for Pentagon planners. Starlink works well, but officials insist they don’t want to become overly dependent on any single vendor.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Defense Department has committed to a next-generation communications strategy, pushing for hybrid space networks that tap into its own classified satellites, those from commercial players and from U.S. allies. These satellites would span multiple orbits — low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) — to ensure redundancy and resilience.\n",
            "\n",
            "But this hybrid network requires solving technical and business challenges that the Pentagon has struggled with for years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Building the space internet\n",
            "\n",
            "DoD’s plan for achieving satellite interoperability centers on something called the Enterprise Satellite Communications Management and Control (ESC-MC) system, a mission control center that would provide a “common operational picture” of all available satellite networks, automatically routing communications through the best available path.\n",
            "\n",
            "But ESC-MC is only as good as the infrastructure supporting it. The military needs to modernize its ground stations (called teleports), many of which were built for older geostationary satellites. It also needs new “hybrid terminals” that can switch between different satellite networks using software rather than hardware swaps.\n",
            "\n",
            "The good news is that all three military branches are now developing these hybrid terminals — something Dean called “unprecedented.” The Air Force could field its first hybrid terminal by 2026, though the other services are taking what Van Slett described as a “crawling, walking, running” approach.\n",
            "\n",
            "Seamless satellite services\n",
            "\n",
            "For now, the Pentagon’s vision of seamless satellite internet remains aspirational. The technical challenges are solvable as the commercial industry already does multi-network routing and virtualization, Van Slett noted. But applying these techniques to military networks, with their unique security and reliability requirements, requires coordination across dozens of companies and government agencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We think about the space segment, we think about the terminals, but we always forget the ground,” Dean said, highlighting how complex the challenge really is. Building a true satellite internet requires not just satellites and terminals, but a complete reimagining of the ground infrastructure that connects space-based networks to terrestrial ones.\n",
            "\n",
            "Van Slett put it more bluntly: The user terminal — the gear that connects soldiers to satellites — is still the “tail that wags the dog.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Ideally, modems and converters that enable compatibility between vendors would be replaced with standardized, software-upgradable servers, he said. “If a new waveform is developed, I don’t have to buy a brand new modem and field another rack of bespoke pizza boxes to get to that capability.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Gopal argues the satcom industry has made notable strides toward interoperability even if it hasn’t adopted standards comparable to cellular communications — a much larger industry that has been working on standards for decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the challenges, officials insist the military is committed to building a hybrid satcom future. “The way we need to get to resiliency across a number of areas is through greater diversification,” Van Slett said....\n",

            "URL: https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/\n",
            "Content:\n",
            "Dune: Awakening has only been out for a little more than a week (even longer if you've been playing since its premium early access release), and players are already looking towards what's coming next for the game.\n",
            "\n",
            "It'll still be a while before Funcom releases any major content updates, but one element we can expect, according to the studio's community manager, Ignasis Miró Sastre, is that the team will add more \"Hagga-Basin-like maps\" in future updates.\n",
            "\n",
            "Writing on the Dune: Awakening Discord server (spotted by Eurogamer), Sastre wrote, \"I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Hagga Basin is the starting area in Dune: Awakening, where players can start finding their sand legs before traveling further into the desert, and eventually to the deep desert and the game's more PvP-focused areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's an area of the game that players have a strong fondness for, if only because it doesn't have the same potential for the kinds of horror stories players have experienced with a trip into the deep desert. A new area like Hagga Basin would be more than welcomed by Dune: Awakening players, to have that same well-curated exploration on Arrakis that Hagga Basin delivers in a fresh way.\n",
            "\n",
            "And it'll feel even better since it'll likely be free, as Sastre later comments that \"Content will come as part of free updates, as far as I am aware. If it ever comes as part of a paid package, I imagine it would be because it's something big. But for now I think we have said we plan to release content for free, and then optional stuff via optional DLCs so we can actually afford rent, lights, and pineapple on pizza.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Hopefully we'll be able to hear about whatever the next Hagga-Basin-like map is soon, and it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we did, since the studio also just confirmed in a Reddit AMA that it plans to release PvE-focused content \"every 3/4 months.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out,\" Funcom wrote in response to a question about PvE plans. \"Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "So for now, we can look to sometime in September/October for when the next major batch of content is out for Dune: Awakening. Though, the studio also stipulates elsewhere in the AMA that while it will always communicate its plans for what's next in the game with the community, it might not necessarily publish a static roadmap.\n",
            "\n",
            "So far, Dune: Awakening is having an incredibly strong launch, with a new concurrent player count of 189,333 players that was reached this past weekend. It'll be interesting to see how the game continues to grow with the coming updates....\n",

            "The United States conducted strikes targeting three nuclear facilities with bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk cruise missiles.

            "\n",
            "US strikes\n",
            "\n",
            "The United States conducted strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites, including the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEEP) in Qom Province.[1] A US official told the New York Times that six American warplanes dropped 12 30,000-lb GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrator (MOP) bunker-busting bombs on Fordow.[2] The standard payload of a B-2 bomber is 40,000 kg, but the bomber refueled immediately after takeoff.[3] US President Donald Trump said on June 21 that US strikes were a \"spectacular military success\" and were a part of the US objective to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity.[4] Trump said the facilities were “completely and totally obliterated.” The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff said all three sites sustained \"extreme damage and destruction.”[5] The chairman added that he did not yet have a complete battle damage assessment at this time, however. A senior Israeli official told Axios that US strikes set back Iran's nuclear program by years.[6] The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that there has been ”no increase in off-site radiation levels” following the attacks.[7]\n",
            "\n",
            "Satellite imagery of Fordow from June 22 shows six probable entry-point craters on top of a ridge above the underground complex that houses two halls of at least 2000 centrifuges. Approximately half of the centrifuges at Fordow are advanced IR-6 centrifuges. The Wall Street Journal reported that Fordow was producing nearly enough highly enriched uranium to fuel one nuclear weapon per month. Two unspecified Israeli officials with knowledge of the matter said initial Israeli assessments indicate that US strikes did not destroy but inflicted serious damage to the site at Fordow.[8] The officials added that it appears Iran moved materials and equipment from the site ahead of the strike. A senior US official similarly said that the US strikes did not destroy but severely damaged the Fordow nuclear site and took it “off the table.”[9]\n",
            "\n",
            "The US official also told the New York Times that a US B-2 bomber dropped two GBU-57 MOPs on the Natanz nuclear site.[10] Israel has previously struck Natanz multiple times since the start of Israel’s air campaign against Iran on June 12.[11] IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi previously stated that Israeli strikes likely damaged or destroyed several thousand centrifuges at Natanz.[12] Satellite imagery from June 22 shows a probable entry-point crater at the above-ground complex at the Natanz nuclear site.\n",
            "\n",
            "The United States separately struck an unspecified nuclear site in Esfahan with cruise missiles.[13] It is unclear what site the US strikes targeted. Israel has previously targeted the Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTC) on June 13 and 21 and caused substantial damage to several facilities in the complex, including centrifuge production facilities and a uranium conversion plant.[14] Satellite imagery from June 22 shows that US strikes likely damaged additional buildings within the complex. The United States may have also struck a new Iranian nuclear facility south of Natanz in Esfahan Province. The Institute for Science and International Security reported in April 2025 that Iran is constructing a security perimeter around two underground nuclear tunnel complexes located within Mount Kolang Gaz La, south of the Natanz enrichment complex.[15] Iran announced in September 2020 that it was building a tunnel complex near Natanz to make advanced centrifuges after a former centrifuge production facility was destroyed in July 2020.[16]\n",
            "\n",
            "Iran has taken steps to begin its retaliation for the US strikes. The Iranian Parliament approved a measure on June 22 to close the Strait of Hormuz, which would disrupt international shipping.[17] Iranian media reported that the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) still needs to provide final approval.[18] Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi stated on June 22 that Iran “reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interests, and people.”[19] An open-source observer citing Windward confirmed that vessels are experiencing Global Positioning System (GPS) interference in the Strait of Hormuz.[20] Iran has previously threatened to disrupt international shipping in response to US or Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.[21] Around 20 percent of global oil exports flow through the Strait of Hormuz.\n",
            "\n",
            "Iran launched two missile barrages at Israel after the US strikes.[22] This attack may or may not be in retaliation for the US strikes on Iran. Iran could expand its retaliation to include attacks on US forces in the region. It may be several days before Iran responds directly against the United States. Iran fired ballistic missiles at US forces at Ain al Asad Airbase in Iraq five days after the US strike that killed IRGC Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020.[23] An Iranian source close to the regime posted on X that it “seems like” Iran's response to US strikes will include attacking “one or more US positions in the region” and ”continuing the war with Israel with continuous strikes.”[24]\n",
            "\n",
            "Iran has launched two ballistic missile attacks on Israel since CTP-ISW's June 21, 5:00 PM EST data cut off.[25] Iran launched the two ballistic missile barrages after the United States conducted strikes against the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and nuclear sites in Esfahan and Natanz.[26] Israeli sources reported missile or interceptor impacts in Haifa and Tel Aviv from the two barrages, which injured several people in both cities.[27] The IDF Air Force also struck six Iranian missile launch platforms and operators arming the missiles to strike Israel on June 22.[28] An IRGC spokesperson announced that these missile attacks employed a mix of long-range liquid- and solid-fuel ballistic missiles.[29] Iran fired between 22 and 30 missiles targeting Israel in these two barrages.[30] Israeli emergency services responded to at least 10 impacts throughout the country.[31]\n",
            "\n",
            "Israeli air defenses have intercepted 30 one-way attack drones launched from Iran overnight.[32] One drone flew over the southern Golan Heights.[33] Two other drones entered near southern Israel.[34]\n",
            "\n",
            "The IDF continued its campaign to destroy Iranian military infrastructure on June 22. Social media users reported Israeli airstrikes on an IRGC division headquarters in Tabriz, northwest Iran, on June 22.[35] The IRGC 31st Ashoura Mechanized Division operates at the site.[36] CTP-ISW has observed fewer reports of Israeli airstrikes from social media accounts based in Iran, which likely reflects widespread internet disruptions in Iran rather than an actual decrease in Israeli airstrikes.[37]\n",

For all the benefits that the rebuild has brought, their lack of a consistent go-to scorer is arguably the biggest thing holding the Rockets back from making a deep playoff run.\n",

With Durant, an analytical darling, there should be more rhythm and flow in Houston’s execution.\n",

            "According to NBA.com tracking, Durant averaged 5.7 catch-and-shoot attempts last season, which led the team. His effective field goal percentage (66.9) and three-point efficiency (45.6 percent) also led the team.

            "Since the season ended, Ishbia has promised an organizational makeover, one built around toughness and grit. This is the start. At the 2023 trade deadline, Phoenix had acquired Durant for a package that included Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson and four unprotected future first-round picks. While the Suns didn’t come close to matching what they gave up to acquire Durant, this might have been the best they could do under the circumstances.\n",

            "Green is a high-scoring guard who has improved over his four NBA years. He’s explosive, athletic and dependable. He’s played all 82 games the past two seasons, and this season averaged a team-best 21 points while shooting a career-best 35.4 percent on 8.1 attempts per game. Last October, Green signed a three-year rookie extension worth $106 million.\n",
            "\n",
            "The obvious issue: The trade gives Phoenix an overflow of guards. Green joins a group that includes Devin Booker, Bradley Beal and Grayson Allen. Booker and Green could give Phoenix a dynamic backcourt if the chemistry is right, something Phoenix battled with Durant.\n",
            "\n",
            "Brooks is among the league’s biggest irritants, a small forward who loves to get inside the heads of opponents. He has the toughness Phoenix seeks, but he often goes too far. His 19 technical fouls this season trailed only the Minnesota Timberwolves’ Anthony Edwards. Brooks has two years left on a contract worth $41.1 million.\n",

            "The No. 10 pick positions Phoenix to add a solid rotation player at a position of need, someone like Duke center Khaman Maluach. The Suns also have the 29th pick, so they have an opportunity to change the roster quickly. — Doug Haller, Arizona senior writer\n",

            "\n",
            "Although fans appreciated Durant’s greatness, his time in Phoenix will not be remembered fondly. He and Booker never became a dominant duo, and they could not replicate the chemistry displayed last summer on Team USA’s gold-medal run at the Paris Olympics. Adding Beal before the 2023-24 season didn’t help. Beal, a three-time All-Star and high-level scorer, struggled to stay healthy and to find a role.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the Suns won one playoff series with Durant, a 2023 first-round series against a Los Angeles Clippers team missing key players. In 2024, the Suns were swept in the first round by Minnesota. This season, they didn’t even make the play-in tournament. The Suns had a different head coach for all three of Durant’s seasons.\n",
            "\n",
            "Phoenix is still likely to make moves. The Suns are expected to try to part ways with Beal, but his salary (he is owed nearly $111 million over the next two seasons) and contract (he has a no-trade clause) will make that difficult. Phoenix explored moving Beal in February but never came close to making a deal.\n",

Over 10 years, Booker has experienced some of the best Phoenix seasons and some of the worst. He is eligible this summer for a two-year extension worth $150 million. Booker will play next season for Jordan Ott, a first-time head coach the Suns hired this month after an extensive search. — Haller\n",

The 69-year-old, who joined the Los Angeles-based spicy chicken chain in 2019 after leading Blaze Pizza and Wetzel’s Pretzels, is sitting next to his second in-command, Dave’s president and COO Jim Bitticks, another Blaze alumnus, on one side of a large conference room table in Forbes’ Jersey City office.\n",

            "On the other side are two of Dave’s four cofounders, Arman Oganesyan, 33, and Dave Kopushyan, 34, who do indeed look like they’re on their way to (or from) a big night out. Kopushyan, a cook who is the brand’s namesake, is coolly dressed in a white T-shirt and blue-washed jeans covered in Black stars. Oganesyan, meanwhile, dons a bright pink and orange Versace silk shirt, matching pink sunglasses and a Hermes belt with shorts, his arms and legs exposed to show intricate tattoos.\n",

            "Though both claim no mischief the night prior, the duo have plenty to celebrate. Their visit to Forbes is the last stop on a whirlwind two-day press tour following the June 2 announcement that Dave’s sold 70% of its business to Roark Capital – the private equity giant that owns Subway, Dunkin’, Buffalo Wild Wings among other restaurant brands – at a $1 billion valuation. After the interview, they’re hopping on a private jet from Teterboro Airport back to Los Angeles.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dave’s was founded in 2017 by Oganesyan, Kopushyan, and brothers Tommy and Gary Rubenyan. All four were children of Armenian immigrants who grew up together in East Hollywood and high school dropouts. They started the business as a pop-up in a parking lot near where they grew up. Their cayenne-coated, Nashville-style chicken, which comes in six different spice levels (the hottest of which, “The Reaper” requires buyers to sign a waiver), gained an immediate cult following. Continued social media hype around the brand, which says its brand organically generates millions of views a week on TikTok, along with a cadre of celebrity investors including rapper Drake helped turn Dave’s into a $620 million (2024 systemwide sales) business with over 300 global locations — and a prime takeover target.\n",

Each owned roughly 10% of the business prior to the sale and is selling around 80% of their stakes, amounting to around $80 million (pre-tax). “The money’s in our accounts,” says Oganesyan, who admits he Googled whether Roark could request the money back. “Wires are permanent. Even if you mistakenly wire money to somebody, you can’t take it back.” (The day before announcing the Roark deal, Oganesyan, a former standup comedian who is Dave’s chief business officer, posted a photo of himself sitting on the hood of an electric blue McLaren with the caption: “Patiently waiting for all my relatives in Armenia to call and ask me for money.”)\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s quite a jump from the last time they cashed out. The founders previously sold half the business – Dave’s had just one location at the time – for $2 million in 2018 to an investor group led by CEO Phelps and the Hollywood producer John Davis, son of billionaire oil and entertainment tycoon Marvin Davis (d. 2004) who is now a prominent food investor. (The pair had having previously worked together on Wetzels, which Phelps founded, and on Blaze Pizza.) “I fell in love with the boys. There was something about them,” says Davis, who claims he knew from the beginning: “This is a $1 billion company.”\n",
            "\n",
            "It was really Phelps and Davis who helped it grow so big so fast and, while the duo have worked on the other two restaurant concepts together, this one is the most successful concept to date in terms of the company’s ultimate valuation. Phelps and Davis both made 250 times their initial investment. According to Davis, he and Phelps were the largest shareholders in the company at the time of the sale to Roark, with roughly equal stakes. (Davis declined to share his ownership stake but says he still kept some after the sale.) Phelps, who also declined to reveal his ownership stake, says he sold off half of his shares and adds that he and the rest of his investment group voted to give away a chunk of their earnings to create a bonus pool for Dave’s executives and employees, around 20 of whom will become millionaires. “The average bonus for the support people all the way down to assistant restaurant manager level was about $100,000,” adds COO Bitticks.\n",
            "\n",
            "A lot of things had to go right for Dave’s to end up where it did. One important factor was the founders’ timely bet on chicken. “The two hottest new concepts in the restaurant world are coffee and chicken,” says John Gordon, a restaurant industry expert who is the founder of Pacific Management Consulting Group. In 2010, chicken overtook beef as the most popular meat in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A seemingly insatiable appetite for the protein has helped chicken joints including Raising Cane’s, Wingstop and Dave’s rank among the fastest growing restaurant chains in America in recent years.\n",

            "Oganesyan says it was this burgeoning trend that prompted him to approach his friend Kopushyan, who he met in middle school, back in 2017. It was a tough sell at first. Kopushyan, who previously worked as a line cook at famed chef Thomas Keller’s Bouchon restaurant in Los Angeles, was a vegetarian working at Elf Cafe, a veggie restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. But after a month of lobbying, Oganesyan managed to convince his friend, who developed a recipe he says is 98% the same as the one Dave’s currently sells. The pair recruited Tommy Rubenyan and his older brother Gary, who would later help put up the money to open the first store.\n",

            "A rave review from local food blog Eater LA five days into business made Dave’s an overnight sensation. Within a year, they opened their first restaurant in East Hollywood. Despite being in an area Phelps describes as a “dump” – “we would never approve that site today,” adds Bitticks – Dave’s food went so viral that the founders claim the restaurant ended the year doing $5 million in sales.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It was the cult following,” says Phelps. “It was what they created through Instagram, the [Eater LA] article… It drew people to the restaurant like crazy and there would be two hour lines for that store.” The brand initially relied heavily on marketing its products through Instagram. But it’s also become a big hit on TikTok, where it’s trendy for people to post videos of themselves eating and reviewing Dave’s’ sliders, nuggets and fries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not surprisingly, the founders say there was immediate interest from investors. They shrugged off most inquiries but one stood out: A post-it note left with the restaurant’s manager. “It just said ‘founders call John Davis,” recalls Kopushyan.\n",
            "\n",
            "Davis is one of Hollywood’s most prolific producers with more than 115 credits – including “Predator” and “Doctor Dolittle” – and $8 billion in box office earnings for the films he’s backed. Over the past three decades, he’s also made a name for himself as a successful early backer of early-stage fast-casual concepts. In 1997, Davis bought into Wetzel’s Pretzels, an Auntie Annie’s competitor founded by Phelps and Rick Wetzel (Davis and his investment group sold their stake in the business in 2008 at a valuation of $36 million). Davis and Phelps teamed up again in 2012 when they became two of the earliest investors in Blaze Pizza, another restaurant concept founded by Wetzel and his wife Elise. They sold their minority stake in the 380 restaurant chain for an estimated $250 million in 2017.\n",

            "Davis, who is also an investor in Pop-up Bagels, has a simple formula for building winning restaurant brands: bring on board his posse of trusted investors including Phelps, actor Samuel L. Jackson and celebrity investment advisor Paul Wachter (“we just go from deal to deal”), take the biggest ownership stake, install his own management team and install a celebrity to help rep the brand. Davis did exactly this with Dave’s, convincing Phelps, who he’d worked with at both Wetzel’s and Blaze, to run the brand instead of retiring.\n",
            "\n",
            "Immediately after the deal, Dave’s began franchising with the help of a management team almost entirely carried over from Blaze.\n",

            "Dave’s second restaurant opened in 2019 and then six more the next year, according to data from the restaurant industry data collector Technomic. They targeted franchisors who had owned a Blaze, Wetzel’s or another fast casual restaurant previously. Phelps also helped several executives, including Bitticks and Dave’s CFO James McGehee, buy franchise locations (Bitticks owns three currently and has plans to open up two more). Dave’s founders now own a combined seven locations.\n",
            "\n",
            "By 2022, a year after Dave’s announced rapper Drake as its big celebrity backer (Drake is a client of Wachter’s, who helped bring him into the deal, according to Davis), they’d opened nearly 100 locations, many of them in California. They’ve since more than tripled that number, expanding into 46 different states and seven countries. Dave’s systemwide sales hit $617 million last year, up from $392 million in 2023, the Technomic data shows. In 2020, sales were just $22 million.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s not uncommon for trendy food restaurants to hit the gas too quickly on their brick and mortar growth, then suffer when they fall out of style. This is what happened with Subway, which was acquired by Roark last year for over $9 billion after shuttering nearly a quarter of its locations over the past decade. Blaze, Phelps and David’ previous venture, shut 30 locations, or 10% of its total stores, last year, according to Kevin Schimpf, senior director of industry research at Technomic. Blaze’s sales also dropped from $400 million in 2023 to $357 million in 2024. When asked whether their chain has any reservations about growing too quickly, Dave’s leadership is dismissive.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We understand this business really well,” says Bitticks of Dave’s. “We’re going to go from opening 80 restaurants last year to roughly 155 this year, to almost 165 or 170 next year. That's the kind of growth we can maintain.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The company isn’t worried about competitors. “I went into a Popeye’s and had their spicy chicken sandwich and said, ‘We’re going to be rich,” says Phelps. Even beloved brands like Chick-Fil-A and Raising Cane’s don’t rattle him, citing the eating patterns of his two young adult sons. “They eat out twice a day,” he says. “It’s not like you only have one shot to eat out this week and it’s either Dave’s or Raising Cane’s.”\n",
            "\n",
            "They’re talking a big game but, at least for now, Dave’s is still a small fry. According to Phelps, the average Dave’s restaurant brings in around $3 million a year in sales (EBITDA margins are between 18% and 20%); data from Technomic suggests that number is closer to $2.5 million. This outpaces the likes of Popeyes, which recorded around $1.9 million in average sales at its more than 2,400 locations last year. But Dave’s sales pale in comparison to some of its more ferocious competitors: Chick-Fil-A averaged $9.3 million at its free-standing and drive-thru restaurants last year, while Raising Cane’s reportedly hit $6.2 million in average unit volume.\n",
            "\n",
            "R oark began circling Dave’s five years ago when it had just 15 locations. The owners joked that the private equity firm was “stalking” the brand as they were constantly being courted at conferences or, in Phelps’ case, even one time on the golf course.\n",

            "\n",
            "In the end, the owners were keen enough on the $1 billion offer and worried enough about Trump’s tariffs and ensuing economic uncertainty that they rushed to close the deal through a “truncated sales process” after agreeing to the deal initially in January, according to Bitticks. “The [mergers & acquisitions market] has been very quiet,” echoes Gordon, the restaurant analyst. Plus, there’s another good reason for Dave’s to get the deal done now: “Eating out is a form of entertainment,” says Gordon. “You need to sell when the concept is hot.” What’s trending one day may not be trending the next. And as a business deeply rooted in trends, Dave’s may be particularly vulnerable to changing cultural tides.\n",
            "\n",
            "Davis, for his part, says it was largely his decision for Dave’s owners to cash out when they did. “We have to take care of our investors and give them the opportunity to get out what they want,” he says. “What I recommended to all of them is when everything is perfect, that’s the time to get out.” He adds that Roark’s experience is going to “open up” Dave’s to foreign markets, which his team doesn’t have as much expertise in. “This concept is going to be really good in foreign countries.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Dave’s has already sold the rights to open more than 1,000 franchise locations in the U.S., the U.K., the Middle East and Canada over the next five years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the celebratory parade around the sale, Dave’s founders and execs insist they are not walking away any time soon. None are contractually obligated to stay on now the Roark deal is done, but they all say they’re planning to do so. Oganesyan remains Dave’s chief brand officer, while Kopushyan is chief culinary officer. They highlight that they continue to hold a stake in the brand as well as multiple franchise locations. Plus, they say none of the now 55 employees at Dave’s HQ have left the company since it was founded seven years ago.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the customers who may be concerned about what will happen to Dave’s in the hands of private equity: “Our whole journey, when we were in the pop up, people were saying ‘Oh when you guys get a store the quality is going to go down.’ Then when we started franchising, people were like ‘Oh my gosh, the franchising quality is going to go down,’” says Oganesyan. “Every step of the way, people were always like that. And I think what I was always trying to get across to people is, as long as you have founders and people within the brand who care about the food, they care about the experience, the quality will never go down.”\n",
