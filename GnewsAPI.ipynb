            "NEW DELHI : In recent months, 37-year-old Sahiba Singh has been ordering either desserts or snacks such as momos and burgers after 10 pm. The New Delhi resident attributed this to both availability of more brands on quick commerce and food delivery apps, as well as for satiating her own late-night cravings.\n",

            "Singh’s example is emblematic of a new trend emerging among consumers across India. Driven by hectic work schedules and a growing desire for convenience, late-night food and essential deliveries are effectively creating a new ‘prime time’ for restaurants and quick commerce platforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "For instance, food delivery major Swiggy Ltd.’s quick commerce service Instamart is witnessing a surge in late-night orders. “Whether it’s satisfying late-night cravings, grabbing last-minute essentials, or preparing for the next day, customers are increasingly turning to quick commerce for convenience,\" a company spokesperson said. “While metropolitan areas have traditionally led this trend, Instamart is seeing strong adoption spreading across smaller cities, too.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The company operates dark stores throughout the day or for 24 hours in more than 25 cities. Snacks, beverages, ice creams, sexual wellness and feminine hygiene products, among others consistently drive its late-night demand, with spikes during festive seasons.\n",

            "The company did not share data specific to its food ordering app Swiggy. However, in its 2024 food trends report, the food delivery app reported 215 million dinner-time orders–nearly 29% higher than lunch orders. Additionally, chicken burgers proved to be the ultimate midnight indulgence on the food ordering platform with 84 million orders between 12 midnight and 2 am. In its previous two editions, Swiggy did not disclose data for late night or dinner orders.\n",
            "\n",
            "Queries sent to Eternal Ltd, parent of Swiggy’s rival Zomato and its quick commerce platform BlinkIt remained unanswered. However, in its FY24 annual report, the company said most late-night orders came from Delhi NCR, while most breakfast orders came from Bengaluru.\n",

            "Fast food chain Wow! Momo is extending its store opening hours at several locations to later than midnight, up from 11 pm previously, to cater to rising demand. “In many places, we are trying to stay open till late,\" said Sagar Daryani, the company’s chief executive and co-founder.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Late-night orders have become bigger for us than even lunch,\" Daryani said. “This was especially seen during the Indian Premier League (IPL). This is on account of changes in consumer habits, late-night socializing and a propensity to eat out more.\" The shift has been more pronounced in the past 12-18 months, Daryani added.\n",

            "\n",
            "“While some local brands and cloud kitchens in metros do attempt to cater to late-night demand, it remains a niche opportunity with viability challenges,\" Agrawal said.\n",

            "Kedia said that outside of large cities, demand for late-night deliveries remains relatively muted due to fewer late-night workplaces and earlier sleeping habits. “Additionally, administrative restrictions—like local authorities not permitting operations past midnight or housing societies limiting entry—pose logistical challenges for consistent late-night delivery,\" he added.\n",

            "Food is one of the simplest yet most powerful ways to express love, and on Father’s Day, it becomes especially meaningful. Fathers often appreciate the little things: a quiet gesture, a familiar flavour, a plate made just for them. “Cooking something at home, even if it’s humble, can say what words sometimes can’t. It’s a way to honour their quiet strength and ever-steady presence. A favourite dish made with thought and care can bring back memories, spark conversations, and create new moments to cherish,” says Thirumurugan B, Executive Chef, Sterling Kodai Lake. Father’s Day is a time to honour quiet strength, steady love, and unsung sacrifices. “At Anthara French and American Bakery, we believe food can express what words often cannot, especially for fathers who may not always wear their emotions on their sleeves. A lovingly prepared dish becomes a heartfelt gesture. It can stir up old memories, surprise with new favourites, and turn an ordinary moment into something meaningful,” says Balasunda-ram Murugesan, founder, chef & director at Anthara.\n",

Vinayak Patil, Corporate Head Chef, The Bigg Small Cafe + Bar, adds, “Food is a heartfelt way to show love, and Father’s Day is the perfect time to create something both personal and indulgent. A Filter coffee banana bread — with its sponge, a flavourful twist on the classic banana bread, infused with the rich, aromatic taste of South Indian filter coffee —makes a sweet and thoughtful tribute to the hero at home.”\n",

            "Father’s Day gives us that rare opportunity to turn the spotlight on them. Food is one of the most genuine ways to show you care. Especially for dads who may not be the most expressive, a thoughtfully prepared meal can say everything that words sometimes cannot. It doesn’t have to be extravagant — just something made with intent that tells him, ‘This is just for you.’ Whether it’s grilled over hot coals or simmered low and slow, it creates a moment where he gets to pause, savour, and feel appreciated. Here is a collection of recipes that reflect this ethos and have the love for father ingrained in them.\n",

            "3. In Andhra homes, Chalimidi is not just a sweet; it’s a sacred tradition. It’s offered to the bride wrapped in a saree, sent after her wedding, after her delivery, and during every good occasion from her family as a ‘chaluva,’ something meant for her well-being, sweetness, and blessings. “When my parents—my mom from Telangana and my dad from Andhra Pradesh—were getting married, this dish was needed. But on my mom’s side, this tradition was completely unheard of. However, my dad, an unapologetic Chalimidi lover, didn’t wait for the bride’s side to bring it. Instead, he made sure his side brought it along wrapped with love and soaked in jaggery. And that one small gesture, that one bowl of Chalimidi, bridged more than just taste; it brought a smile, curiosity, and eventually, a tradition that was embraced by everyone. But today, on Father’s Day, I wanted to turn that tradition around. If Chalimidi is meant as a chaluva for the bride’s well-being, then why not offer it to all fathers who build a home of togetherness, who preserve traditions, and who add their own flavour of love into everything?” says Tiruveedhula.\n",

The author also uses platforms like X to regularly troll her critics and take aim at public figures (such as slamming John Oliver’s comments on trans athletes). Both HBO and the new “Harry Potter” cast have received backlash for getting into business with Rowling due to her anti-trans posts.\n",

Strike’ that we do with the BBC. It’s pretty clear that those are her personal, political views. She’s entitled to them. ‘Harry Potter’ is not secretly being infused with anything.

The overnight airstrike on June 21, part of Operation Midnight Hammer, was carried out using B-2 stealth bombers armed with 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs—making it the first known US attempt to penetrate the underground facility near Qom. The move comes after days of Israeli bombardment that failed to significantly damage Fordow, a site central to Iran’s uranium enrichment program and long considered beyond the reach of conventional weapons.\n",

The facility has been used to enrich uranium up to 60% purity — just a short step from the 90% enrichment level needed to produce nuclear weapons. In 2023, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) detected particles enriched to 83.7% purity at the site — the highest level ever publicly recorded in Iran.\n",
            "\n",
            "This brought heightened international scrutiny, especially from Israel, which considers any Iranian move toward weapons-grade material an existential threat. Fordow's fortified location makes it nearly invulnerable to Israeli munitions. Only the United States possesses the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator — a “bunker buster” capable of reaching its underground centrifuge halls.\n",
            "\n",
            "The strikes on Fordow In the early hours of Saturday night (June 21), the United States launched a military operation — Operation Midnight Hammer — targeting Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. US President Donald Trump authorised the use of B-2 stealth bombers equipped with GBU-57 bombs to strike Fordow’s underground halls.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We devastated the Iranian nuclear program,” said US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after the strikes. “This operation was about neutralizing threats — not regime change.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Satellite images reveal surface damage According to satellite imagery and initial Pentagon assessments, the attacks caused visible damage around the facility, including craters and collapsed tunnel entrances.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the IAEA has reported no increase in off-site radiation levels, and a full damage assessment is still underway.\n",
            "\n",
            "Radiation risk and monitoring challenges The IAEA confirmed that no elevated radiation levels have been detected following the strike. But experts caution that radiation and chemical contamination inside the site are likely, and monitoring efforts have become more difficult.\n",
            "\n",
            "Due to the destruction of infrastructure and dispersal of materials, traditional environmental sampling techniques — essential for detecting illicit nuclear activity — may now be unusable at the site.\n",
            "\n",
            "Strategic implications The Fordow strike was viewed as a turning point in the conflict. Israeli airstrikes over the past week had failed to significantly damage Fordow due to its depth and air defenses. By stepping in with bunker busters, the US delivered what many analysts view as a critical blow to Iran’s nuclear capabilities....\n",

            "NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant added another feather to his cap on Sunday as he became only the third Indian wicketkeeper to complete 150 catches in Test cricket. The milestone came on Day 3 of the first Test against England at Headingley, when Prasidh Krishna found the edge of Ollie Pope ’s bat and Pant completed a sharp take behind the stumps.LIVE: India vs England 1st Test Day 3 With that catch, Pant joined an elite club of Indian glovemen, trailing only Syed Kirmani (160 catches) and MS Dhoni (256 catches). He now has 151 catches and 15 stumpings in Tests, taking his overall tally to 166 dismissals - third-best in India’s Test history.The 27-year-old continues to make a roaring comeback after a long injury layoff. On Day 2, he dazzled with the bat, scoring a commanding 134 and marking his seventh Test century. The moment was made even more iconic by a gravity-defying somersault celebration, which has since gone viral on social media.Speaking to Cheteshwar Pujara on the broadcaster's post-match show, Pant revealed that he had considered multiple celebration styles. “I had actually thought of three celebrations. One was the ‘let-the-bat-do-the-talking’ one. Then I realised I should stick to my own style,” he said with a laugh.Pant reached his century in trademark fashion - launching Shoaib Bashir over deep midwicket with one hand on the bat - before unleashing his now-signature flip.With both the gloves and the bat, Pant has proven yet again that he remains one of India’s most explosive and charismatic match-winners....\n",
